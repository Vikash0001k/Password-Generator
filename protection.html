    <div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element">
        <h2>How to Protect Your Passwords</h2>
        <p>Having secure passwords is one of the most important things you can do to ensure your online safety. And the
            good news is, for how important it is, it's actually fairly easy to manage.</p>
        <p>There are two key tips to keeping your password security at top performance. The first is to diversify your
            passwords. This way you can make sure that if something does leak or some hack does happen, that only one
            account is compromised. If your logins are the same for 50 websites, and those details are leaked, it could
            be a catastrophe.</p>
        <p>Secondly, make sure your passwords are <em>hard to guess</em>. This might be
            obvious, but if you were using your mother's maiden name (let's say “Schwartz”) as a password, even changing
            it to “Schvv4rtz!” isn't enough. If someone knows your mother's maiden name, they can plug it into a program
            that can try thousands of possible password permutations every minute. It's better to create a password
            that's entirely random – something like “KittenBomber11Glove.”</p>
        <p>Combining these two tips might lead to a bit of confusion. How are you supposed to have dozens of different
            passwords that aren't even reliably memorable? That's where password managers come in.
            <em>Password managers</em> allow you to catalog all your accounts and passwords in one safe place. All
            you'll have to
            remember is the master password.
        </p>
        <p>Take a look at some of the top options, below. Or, don't say we didn't warn you…</p>

    <div class="password-examples" id="password-examples">
        <h2>Password Examples – Good and Bad</h2>
        <p>If you and your team are creating your own passwords, then the following examples will hopefully highlight
            what to avoid, while providing inspiration to create something secure.</p>
        <p>It's important to be honest with yourself, here. We all slip into bad habits when it comes to online
            security. But, using variations of any of the bad passwords listed below is a recipe for danger, and could
            put your business in danger.</p>
        <p>Don't wait until something goes wrong. Update your passwords to stronger ones now, while your accounts are
            secure, and you won't regret it.</p>

        <div class="characteristics">
            <h2>Characteristics of a Strong Password</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At least 12 characters in length</li>
        <li>Includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters</li>
        <li>Contains numbers and special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $)</li>
        <li>Avoids common words, phrases, and patterns</li>
        <li>Is unique and not used across multiple accounts</li>
    </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Good Password Examples -->
        <div class="good-password">
            <h3 style="color: green; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><i>Good Passwords</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don’tStopBelieving</strong> – Using song lyrics in a passphrase can be a very easy way of
                    remembering a secure password. This will be very difficult for a computer to brute force attack
                    successfully. But be wary of lyrics from music that you may have listed as your favorite on social
                    media.</li>
                <li><strong>BatmanIsTheGreatestHeroOfAllTime</strong> – Using a memorable phrase can be an effective way
                    of creating a password. Again, don't pick one that people may be able to guess.</li>
                <li><strong>DogComputerScreenSpeakerTV</strong> – A list of words is another very strong method. This
                    example would take 327 septillion years to crack by brute force.</li>
                <li><strong>D0gComput3r$creenSpe&kerTV</strong> – This may be slightly more difficult to remember, but
                    replacing some letters with symbols and numbers significantly boosts the security of the password.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Bad Password Examples -->
        <div class="bad-password">
            <h3 style="color: red; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;"><i>Bad Passwords</i></h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Password</strong> – This is an obvious one, but it’s still one of the most common passwords
                    used today!</li>
                <li><strong>12345678</strong> – Number sequences with an order or pattern to them will be cracked almost
                    instantly by any rapid sequence attack.</li>
                <li><strong>Banking01</strong> – Don’t use descriptive passwords that are relevant to the application
                    being used. Using patterns like this would compromise the security of all accounts if one password
                    was figured out.</li>
                <li><strong>01/01/2000</strong> – Avoid using dates, especially if the date has some personal
                    significance (eg. birthdays, anniversaries, etc.) as this will be easier information for an attacker
                    to find.</li>
                <li><strong>Q!koP9$f</strong> – While this provides protection from dictionary attacks, it will only
                    take about 9 hours for a brute force attack to crack this kind of password.</li>
                <li><strong>maga2023!</strong> – Looking at you, Donald. A password that can be guessed in just five
                    goes isn't good enough (and the same goes for yourefired)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cracking-passwords" id="cracking-passwords">
        <h2>How Are Passwords Cracked?</h2>
        <p>It's not unusual for regular, everyday people to have their passwords guessed by someone. It could be a
            suspicious spouse, nosey roommate, or even a child guessing the password to unlock blocked content. More
            seriously still, this is a very real threat at a corporate espionage level.</p>

        <p>But, there's more to cracking a password than guesswork based on your maiden name, first pet, or alma mater
            year.</p>

        <p>Unlike a “dictionary attack,” where the attacker runs a rapid series of common passwords, a “brute force”
            attack runs all possible combinations of characters. The rising popularity of brute force attacks has led to
            a shift in the importance of password strength factors. This changes everything from the recommended
            complexity to the length of your password.</p>
        <h3>General methods that Cybercriminals use to crack passwords:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brute Force Attacks</strong> – Trying every possible combination until the correct password is found.</li>
            <li><strong>Dictionary Attacks</strong> – Using a list of common words and phrases to guess the password.</li>
            <li><strong>Rainbow Tables</strong> – Precomputed tables of encrypted passwords to quickly match against hashed passwords.</li>
        </ul>
